<h3 align="center">I'm XtoManuel, passionate about video games, programming, and online community management. Here, you'll find details about me.</h3>

### :briefcase: Work Experience

#### :joystick: Gaming Events

My work experience includes inventory management and logistical coordination for events, involving both space setup and teardown. Additionally, I've served as an activities monitor during these events, where I've been responsible for advising, guiding, supervising, motivating, and ensuring the safety and enjoyment of participants during activities.

#### :office: Entrepreneur

Since September 2022, I founded my own company, which represents the continuation of a family business tradition spanning generations. In my role as a sole administrator and self-employed corporate member, I take full responsibility for managing and operating the business. My current academic background as a mathematics student has been a valuable asset to the company, allowing me to apply my knowledge in areas such as statistics and accounting. This translates into more precise and strategic financial management, as well as the ability to effectively analyze data to make informed decisions. I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to drive the growth and ongoing success of the company.

### :school: Education

I have an academic background in Science and Technology, having completed my high school diploma in this field. Currently, I am pursuing a university degree in Mathematics, providing me with a solid foundation in mathematics. My academic background has also taught me programming and computer skills.

### :game_die: Hobbies

#### :video_game: Video Games

I have a deep passion for video games, especially those that offer multiplayer experiences. When I play solo, I immerse myself in captivating linear story games. My love for video games has led me to actively participate in gaming community events. Currently, I am a member of the esports team **[Guardians E.C.](https://discord.gg/e5c4CfWwdY 'Discord Link')**, where I serve as a Community Manager. In this role, I collaborate with the team in event assistance, make announcements and promotions on social media, and contribute to creating a positive experience for our members and followers.

#### :speech_balloon: Discord

Since April 2018, I began my journey as a moderator on communication platforms like Discord. Over time, and with accumulated experience, I advanced from moderation roles to server administration positions, especially on servers of well-known streamers. Currently, I have the honor of serving as a moderator and administrator on the **[Willyrex](https://discord.gg/willyrex 'Discord Link')** and **[elyas360](https://discord.gg/elyas360 'Discord Link')** servers. Furthermore, I actively contribute to the administration of my esports team's server and provide support in managing servers for close friends. This experience has allowed me to develop strong skills in online community management and ensure a welcoming and safe environment for users.

### :desktop_computer: Programming

My journey in the programming world began at the start of my university career when I had to delve into languages like C/C++ and Python with no prior knowledge in this field. This initial challenge sparked my interest in programming, leading me to explore online resources and learn these languages self-taught. Over time, my curiosity led me to research NodeJS for creating Discord bots, an experience that further expanded my programming skills.

Currently, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in Python, NodeJS, and HTML/CSS. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning in the exciting field of programming.
